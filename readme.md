#jQuery 101
###Welcome to our introductory class into jQuery.

We're going to cover some really cool things in this class, building all sorts of usable, real life examples of things you see all over the place on the internet.

In this repository you'll find all our exercises for each day of class, with boilerplate files that will be left intentionally empty (mostly). You are to fill these in as we go through the class. Then, as you complete them, I'll fill them in and push up the changes to this repo so you can reference them as the answers to the exercises.

You won't have the answers to the exercises in this repo until we go through it in class, that's intentional. You gotta do this stuff for yourself to really learn it!

But I'll be there the whole time answering questions and giving guidance.

###Assumptions going into this class
*There are a few things that are assumed of you before you take this class. This class goes over some complicated javascript logic. We are going to assume that you have a good grasp of javascript and understand basic things like variables, arrays, functions, and objects.*
